This repository showcases a common yet subtle error in PHP programming related to loose comparison.  The `bug.php` file contains code that demonstrates how an empty string and the integer 0 are considered equal using the `==` operator. This behavior can be problematic if strict equality (`===`) is not used, potentially leading to unexpected program flow.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version using strict comparison to resolve this issue.  Always favor strict comparison in PHP to prevent these types of bugs.
